  title: The Boron & De Weer Model of Intracellular pH Regulation
  description: >-
    The classic Boron & De Weer (1976) paper provided the first evidence of
    active regulation of pH in cells by an energy-dependent acid-base
    transporter. This Physiome paper seeks to make that model, and the
    experimental conditions under which it was developed, available in a
    reproducible and well-documented form, along with a software implementation
    that makes the model easy to use and understand.
